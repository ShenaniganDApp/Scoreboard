To Do

Deliverable 1
1. loop over all mints/burns until there is timestamp greater than march 1st
2. in that loop add all the mints for each account, and burns
3. subtract the burns from the mints
4. the result is the state of the LP on March 1st
5. create list of objects that have the sender, and the amount staked on March 1st, key/value

Deliverable 2
1. start loop at March 1st (timestamp)
2. loop over everything up until today (or whatever interval we want)
3. add all mints, and subtract burns from the previous state (above)


When looping over the data, navigate by checking:
    - if the sender is in the initial state
        - add the mint or subtract the burn
        - if not, its a mint, add them to the list
